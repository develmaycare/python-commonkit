Setup

Distribution requires setuptools, wheel, and twine. While setuptools is mostly likely already installed, you will need
to install wheel and twine: pip install twine wheel

The .gitignore file should include: build, dist, *.egg-info

Notes

For convenience, the Makefile contains two targets:

- dist: To create and test the distribution.
- publish: To publish to PYPI.

After make dist, It's a good idea to publish to the PYPI test site first:

twine upload --repository-url https://test.pypi.org/legacy/ dist/*

You can test the install (in a virtual env) using:

pip install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ superpython

The version must always be bumped to avoid a "file already exists" error. Also, be sure to update the Development Status
classifier in setup.py if appropriate.

Checklist:

1. Make sure all tests are passing.
2. Make sure documentation is built and published.
3. Bump the version if it hasn't been done already.
4. Run: make dist
5. Upload to test: twine upload --repository-url https://test.pypi.org/legacy/ dist/*
6. Run: make publish
7. Satisfaction.
