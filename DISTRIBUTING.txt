# Distributing

## Setup

Distribution requires setuptools, wheel, and twine. While setuptools is mostly likely already installed, you will probably need to install wheel and twine:

```bash
pip install twine wheel
```

The .gitignore file should include:

```text
*.egg-info
build
dist
```

## Notes

For convenience, the Makefile contains two targets:

- dist: To create and test the distribution.
- publish: To publish to PYPI.

After `make dist`, It's a good idea to publish to the PYPI test site first:

```bash
twine upload --repository-url https://test.pypi.org/legacy/ dist/*
```

You can test the install (in a virtual env) using:

```bash
pip install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ python-commonkit
```

> Note: The PYPI test site may not have all of the required dependencies for the package.

Checklist:

1. Make sure the master branch is checked out.
2. Make sure all tests are passing.
3. Make sure documentation is built and published.
4. Bump the version if it hasn't been done already. The version must always be bumped to avoid a "file already exists" error. Also, be sure to update the Development Status classifier in `setup.py` if appropriate.
5. Run: `make dist`
6. Upload to test: `twine upload --repository-url https://test.pypi.org/legacy/ dist/*`
7. Run: `make publish`
8. Satisfaction.
