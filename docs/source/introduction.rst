Overview
========

Building command line tools, web sites, or web applications with Python often includes lots of repetition. Over time, we tend to build up a lot of re-usable libraries that get copied from one project to another.

commonkit is a collection of functionality that can help jump start all sorts of development. It's libraries cover a variety of useful patterns and the utilities provide some common, time-saving functionality.

100% test coverage helps ensure that the components are as error free as possible.
